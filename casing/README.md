# Casing

This folder is used to store photos, schemas, code for the amp case part of the homelab.

## The idea

I decided to use a vintage Hifi amp for the casing, because I enjoy these a lot and I find them nice and more displayable than a custom rack.

The specifications of the amp were the following:
* Enough space to fit 4x Raspberry Pi 4s, 4x SSDs, a switch and power supply
* Discreet holes to let out the heat
* Physical buttons and selectors to reuse
* A display, or a place to put a display
* A nice front panel

I searched for broken amps to find a suitable candidate for my homelab, and I found a Technics SU-V2A, which is ideal because of the multiple front panel buttons, selectors, and potentiometers. Moreover, it has a translucent "New Class A" logo on the bottom right which I can reuse. It also has a small screen.

I completely emptied the case by desoldering every button and parts from the main PCBs.

After finding the repair manual online, I reverse engineered every button and selector, to reuse them in the new system.
